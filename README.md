# DevSecOps Curriculum: Bridging the Gap in Software Engineering Education üåâüéì
## Introduction üìñ
Welcome to our open-source DevSecOps curriculum. This comprehensive resource is designed to equip new graduates, companies, professors, students, and self-learners with practical skills in DevSecOps, thereby bridging the knowledge gap in its principles and practices. Our curriculum prepares students for a smooth transition from academic learning to the professional environment by focusing on real-world applications.

## What is DevSecOps and CI/CD? üîç
**DevSecOps** is an integration of **development** (Dev), **security** (Sec), and **operations** (Ops) practices. It's a cultural shift that emphasizes security as a fundamental part of the software development lifecycle. By introducing security early in the development process, DevSecOps ensures that it's a shared responsibility and not just an afterthought.<sup>1-3</sup>

**CI/CD**, which stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Delivery/Deployment**, complements DevSecOps by automating the software delivery process. Continuous Integration refers to the practice of frequently integrating code changes into a shared repository, followed by automated testing. Continuous Delivery extends this by automatically releasing the validated changes to a repository, while Continuous Deployment goes a step further by automatically deploying the changes into production.<sup>4-6</sup>

Our [Literature Review](research/literature-review.md) provides a comprehensive look at existing academic and industry knowledge on DevSecOps.

## Why are they Important?üåü
- **Rapid and Secure Deployment**: In a fast-paced tech environment, the ability to quickly develop and deploy software is crucial. DevSecOps and CI/CD enable this rapid deployment while maintaining high security standards.
- **Reduced Risk**: Early integration of security in the development process significantly reduces vulnerabilities and the risk of late-stage security issues.
- **Efficiency and Reliability**: Automation in CI/CD ensures that each integration is tested and validated, reducing human errors and increasing the reliability of the release process.
- **Cost-Effective**: Identifying and fixing issues early in the development cycle is less expensive than making changes after deployment. This approach saves resources and time.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Organizations that adopt these practices are more agile, can respond faster to market changes, and offer more secure and reliable products.

Incorporating DevSecOps and CI/CD practices into academic curricula prepares students to meet the demands of modern software engineering, making them valuable assets to the industry from the outset.

## Why DevSecOps and CI/CD in Academia? üéìüíª
The tech world is rapidly evolving, and with it, the requirements of the software industry are changing at an unprecedented pace. Traditional academic curricula often lag behind, particularly in areas like DevSecOps and CI/CD practices. This creates a significant skills gap for graduates entering the industry, who find themselves unprepared for the demands of modern software development and deployment. Key insights from our research highlight this disconnect:

- **Skills Gap**: As per the [Veracode Global Skills Survey](https://www.veracode.com/blog/security-news/veracode-survey-research-identifies-cybersecurity-skills-gap-causes-and-cures), about 70% of respondents stated that new graduates did not receive adequate training for their current positions. This gap is particularly evident in DevSecOps, where the integration of security in the development pipeline is crucial yet often overlooked in academic settings.

- **Demand for Cloud Skills**: Institutions struggle to meet the burgeoning demand for cloud skills. Reports by 451 Research and Robert Half International show a significant portion of organizations and IT leaders citing a lack of skills in managing cloud deployments.

- **Security Risks**: The skills gap in DevSecOps and cloud technology can lead to severe security risks, with data breaches often resulting from misconfigured access controls. A staggering 80% of companies experienced a data breach between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to such issues.

- **Lack of Practical Exposure**: Students often graduate with coding skills but lack exposure to best practices and industry tools for deploying software in production, especially using cloud technologies. This lack of practical, hands-on experience creates a steep learning curve when entering the industry.

- **Cost and Accessibility of External Resources:** Many existing online courses on cloud technologies and DevSecOps are expensive, making it difficult for students to access quality education in these areas.

Our curriculum aims to fill this void by providing up-to-date, practical training in DevSecOps and CI/CD practices. By integrating our modules into existing courses, professors can enrich their curriculum, preparing students for the challenges of modern software development and making them valuable assets to the industry from day one.
