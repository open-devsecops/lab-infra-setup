- 30% have heard of it but never used it
- 83% have not taken classes on either
  - They don't know about the classes
  - Classes are not offered on a regular basis
- Learning through
  - YouTube
  - Previous internships
- 57% have not used external resources to learn about DevSecOps/CICD
- No one was very confident in this
- Overall, 92% think it is important to be taught about in school
- 52% are not confident at all in applying these concepts in industry
- Quotes
  - "I feel like these topics are very application based and are best learned through internships/jobs."
  - "Lack of practice and guidance"
  - "The whole process can be confusing but it is mainly because there aren't enough resources to teach that stuff"
  - "I feel like my major (Informatics) does a poor job of preparing aspiring professionals to go into the tech world, especially related to development. There are very few classes that I can name that teach these core concepts for DevSecOps, cloud computing/software, and CI/CD. We often have to supplement it with outside resources, which take up a lot of time and aren't as nearly effective as taking them in a classroom setting."
  - "We still are in an environment where security is very new and people still don’t want to adopt it, so in terms of classes, classes don’t really put an emphasis on security or just brush over DevSecOps when teaching students how to program or when teaching them a new technical skill"
  - "Well, I feel like there aren't any classes that are tailored toward using CI/CD, and likewise for DevSecOps exclusively as far as I know."

### Full Interview Notes

- B - grad student in cybersecurity
  - Mostly 2s on tools, some 4s (code packaging tools) 2 = not confident on tools
  - Never took classes on it bc not interest in devops
  - INFO 310 / 340/330 glossed over
  - TryHackMe
  - Hackthebox
  - Coursera / Udemy -- typical, other platforms might be more focused
  - leading to a new wave of programmers / devs going out into industry and creating more vulnerabilities (not tecahing devsecops)
  - Guided practice
  - Linkedin/Reddit are good resources. Google can be too ad-focused
  - sometimes difficult to find connection between reading about it and seeing it implemented
  - Talking to friends in swe - classes require it - used security people to deal with that - but if we teach everyone from the beginning to implement it, makes everything a whole lot safer and more secure, and better! Less work
- R - senior in informatics, software engineering focus
  - Confidence - i felt like i had to relearn a lot of coding practices when i was in both internships
  - Had to relearn a lot of core concepts in internship
  - Wasn’t really required in core curriculum - personally i just didn’t learn about the fact that those classes existed until i was well into my junior year - then at that point - i don’t really have that much time to take more classes - very done with info, focusing on minor
  - Amazon provided a whole training
  - CI/CD talked about in internship
  - Never taken 310, but 442, 441, 443 classes go over CI/CD
  - Mostly 2s and 3s - some 4s on platforms (not confident)
  - Never heard those terms before - i kinda understand the practices associated with them but never heard those specific terms in particular
  - Would look at YouTube first, Google
  - Personally - i learn best with both video and an example
  - Not confident applying knowledge
  - all code i have is really small scale for school projects - would be hard to apply principles that are meant to be used at scale for something smaller
  - Wish devsecops was taught in classes
  - Yes 100% - would probably have saved me a lot of time in your internships if i had known some more principles going in
- A - Sophomore in software engineering, CS major
  - All tools - 1-3 - lot of familiarity but not usage
  - Coursera / udemy - very do this, but not do it well
  - No courses teach this explicitly - pick it up along the way
  - Each company has own workflow - wouldn't I have to relearn it
  - every company has own unique security vulnerability in tech stack
  - No wouldn’t feel confident diving straight in esp w someting as imporant as security
  - would look up api to check documentation for vulnerabilities
  - On Google - get content out of date, bad answers
  - Read a book on it
  - Coursera / udemy - very do this, but not do it well
  - Interactive labs in class setting - as homework sure - of course - all programing homeworks should be written basically - implementation
  - 1-2 confidence level in applying concepts
  - important to integrate into curriculum - but they do CI/CD pretty well already
  - cryptography, more theoretical, not towards industry use
  - dimly aware of classes

### Professor Interview Notes - Alexander Bell-Towne

- Class topics covered
  - Start out with words, vocab that’s used in the industry for better communication. Huge piece that was missing for new grads who didn’t understand the vocab used in the industry related to architecture.
  - Second half, design patterns, zooming back in, specific patterns you would see in code to make it more maintainable. "Hard to learn as a student, they are not gonna be good at the start, need to practice a lot, something you develop over time."
- In class activities
  - Can’t teach all patterns, practice learning patterns. Some labs - break up into 4 large group, each group will get a design pattern to learn. Each member will teach other groups one pattern that they learned.
  - Lots of reading, writing, and discussing things. Not a lot of coding.
  - Not a lot of software engineers know automated testing coming into the industry.
- Taught class twice, things that didn’t go well, changed. Adding a new module - openness. Content needs to be ready to go - make as easy as possible. Demonstrate that the module applies to the course being taught. Server side development class would be a great candidate for CI/CD, DevSecOps. "If you convince the teacher that it’s a good idea to teach somethings that’s part of their course, and they’re gonna do it."
- Challenges to adding a module
  - Professors often do add buffer space. Two lectures of buffer space for Alex. Really show the value of it. Make it a concise way, tangible exercises. They might be able to add a week or two worth of content to their existing lecture.
- Once you get it in the course, they’re going to find out if it fits really well or not. Maybe provide a minimal version you could teach, some expanded stuff for later iterations of their course. Give them the resources, let them figure out what fits or not.
